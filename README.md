# 🔧 Predictive Maintenance using Azure ML & IoT Data

This project demonstrates a full-stack solution for predictive maintenance using simulated IoT sensor data, Azure Machine Learning, and Power BI. The goal is to predict potential equipment failures and enable early intervention to reduce downtime.

---

## 🚀 Project Objectives

- Simulate sensor data from industrial equipment
- Stream and store data using Azure IoT services
- Build and train ML models in Azure ML (AutoML & custom models)
- Deploy the model as a REST API using Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
- Visualize live predictions and alerts in Power BI

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Azure IoT Hub** – for ingesting simulated sensor telemetry  
- **Azure Blob Storage** – storing historical data  
- **Azure ML Studio** – model training using AutoML  
- **Python** – for data prep, EDA, and scripts  
- **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)** – model deployment  
- **Power BI** – dashboard for real-time monitoring and predictions
